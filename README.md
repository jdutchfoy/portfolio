## Dutch's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a software developer. As a recent graduate without real-world experience and a US Navy Veteran, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting. I am seeking a company that offers both an innovative and challenging environment while fostering and cultivating my personal growth and development, ensuring a history of successful project delivery.
