# Dutch's Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my projects, skills, and experience as a software developer. As a recent graduate without real-world experience and a US Navy Veteran, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in a professional setting. I am seeking a company that offers both an innovative and challenging environment while fostering and cultivating my personal growth and development, ensuring a history of successful project delivery.

## About Me

My name is Dutch (yes, it's my real name), and I have just completed a Full-stack software development program. With a strong foundation in HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and JSON, I have also gained proficiency in C#, Batchfile, SCSS, and Python.
